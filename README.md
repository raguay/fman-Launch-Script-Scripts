# fman-Launch-Script-Scripts

This is a repository of the different scripts I use with the [fman](http://fman.io) [LaunchScript plugin](https://github.com/raguay/LaunchScripts).

You can use these scripts as examples of things you can do with this fman plugin. If you have some of your own, fork this repository, add your scripts, and issue a pull request. That way, everyone can share their useful scripts.

Have fun!

## Script Description

This is a description for each script in this repository. The two scripts, `compareDir` and `compareFiles` uses the [DeltaWalker](https://www.deltawalker.com/) program to do the comparisons. If you want to use a different program, then change the script to fit your needs.

| Script | Description |
|---|-----|
| compareDir | This script will compare the two directories of each panel. |
| compareFiles | This script will compare the two files that the cursor is on in each panel. |
| simpleserver | This script launches a python server in the current panel's directory. |
| killserver | This script will kill the server started in the `simpleserver` script. |
