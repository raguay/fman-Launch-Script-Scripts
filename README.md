# fman-Launch-Script-Scripts

This is a repository of the different scripts I use with the [fman](http://fman.io) [LaunchScript plugin](https://github.com/raguay/LaunchScripts).

You can use these scripts as examples of things you can do with this fman plugin. If you have some of your own, fork this repository, add your scripts, and issue a pull request. That way, everyone can share their useful scripts.

Have fun!
